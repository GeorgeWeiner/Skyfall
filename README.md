Skyfall student game, made in SAE Vienna.

**Game Concept:**
Skyfall is a parkour / spell
casting, first-person game set
in an abstract and surreal
setting.
The premise of the game is to get from point A to point B without dying, or
falling off in the process. The game attempts to create a change of rhythm by
mixing up the parkour segments with fighting segments to keep things
interesting.
**Core Mechanics:**
A parkour system featuring: Wall-Running, Climbing-Ladders, Climbing up Walls,
Crouching, Jumping, and a responsive Rigid-body based Movement system, which
utilizes some design choices made in the Quake games. (Mostly adding force in
the negative of the current directional Vector to add artificial grip).
The game also features some basic spells. These spells are relatively simple and
have the same core mechanics, with differences in their values. Overall it adds
a little bit extra to the game, but they are not as core to the gameplay as the
parkour elements.
**Gameplay:**
The player can choose multiple paths to get from A to B, which makes the game
replay-able and non-linear. The switching of spells is also essential to be
effective at different ranges, as well as offensive and defensive capabilities.
**Music:**
The Music of the game is kept mostly within the ambient genre, as it seemed like
a good fit for the surreal and abstract qualities inherent to the art-style. It
is supposed to reflect the calm nature of the world the player visits during his
stay.
**Art Style:**
The art style is kept very minimal, mostly using primitives and other basic
geometric shapes. It is not supposed to be realistic, however there are some
elements of realism present within the textures i.e. Asphalt textures for
floors, or slight displacement textures for the primitives.
